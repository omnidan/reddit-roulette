_Easily get to a random subreddit by clicking a button. Wasting time has never been so easy._

What is reddit-roulette?
------------------------

Reddit Roulette is a Chrome extension that adds a button which opens a new tab to get you to a random subreddit.
It won't create new tabs if there is already one open.

Running
-------

Download [Reddit Roulette *1.0* for Chrome](https://github.com/omnidan/reddit-roulette/releases/download/v1.0/reddit-roulette.crx)

Open [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/) in Google Chrome/Chromium. Now drag and drop the .crx file into the window and install it. That's it - You should see a button now!

License

Because this is so simple and I encourage using it as a template for Chrome extensions, reddit-roulette is
