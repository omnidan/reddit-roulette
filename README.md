_Easily get to a random subreddit by clicking a button. Wasting time has never been so easy._

What is reddit-roulette?
------------------------

Reddit Roulette is a Chrome extension that adds a button which opens a new tab to get you to a random subreddit.
It won't create new tabs if there is already one open.
